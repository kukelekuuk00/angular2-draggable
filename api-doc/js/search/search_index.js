has angular directives that make the DOM element draggable and resizable.\n\nngDraggable\n\nv2.x requires Angular 6\nv1.4.2 requires Angular 4\n\n\nngResizable\n\nprovided since v2.0, requires Angular 6\n\n\n\nLatest Update\n\n2018.08.08: 2.0.1\n\nBugfix: click events are blocked. #87, #84\n\n\n2018.08.03: 2.0.0\n\nFix issue #84: iFrames, and context unrelated elements block all events, and are unusable\n\n\n2018.07.02: 2.0.0-beta.2\n\nngResizable: Provide [rzAspectRatio], whether the element should be constrained to a specific aspect ratio. demo\nngResizable: Provide [rzContainment], constrains resizing to within the bounds of the specified element or region. demo\n\n\n2018.06.26: 2.0.0-beta.1\n\nngResizable: Provide (rzStart), (rzResizing), (rzStop) event emitters\nngResizable: Provide resetSize(), getStatus() methods\n\n\n2018.06.25: 2.0.0-beta.0\n\nNew: ngResizable directive which you can use to make the element resizable! More resizable options are planning. Refer to demo\n\n\n2018.05.23: 1.4.2\n\nChanges: expose boundsCheck() method.\n\n\n2018.05.11: 1.4.1\n\nBugfix: Handle Drag is not working in Firefox #68.\n\n\n2018.05.04: 1.4.0\n\nProvide [gridSize] option for snapping to grid. Refer to demo. (PR #64 by PAHADIx)\nCode optimized. (PR #60 by korn3l)\n\n\n2018.04.10: 1.3.2\n\nProvide [outOfBounds] option. Set it to allow element get out of bounds from the direction. Refer to demo. (PR #57 by waldo2188)\n\n\n2018.03.15: 1.3.1\n\nProvide (movingOffset) event emitter: emit position offset when moving\nProvide (endOffset) event emitter: emit position offset when stop moving\n\n\n2018.03.09: 1.3.0\n\nProvide [position] option: to set current position offset.\n\n\n2018.02.08: 1.2.1\n\nBugfix: [preventDefaultEvent] should not prevent events of elements outside the handle.\n\n\n2018.02.07: 1.2.0\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: use Renderer2 of angular-core. So we don't support angular version \nProvide: resetPosition() method to reset position. Refer to demo for details.\nBugfix: [trackPosition] was not working as expected.\nChange: The directive now exportAs: 'ngDraggable'. For example we can use  to assign this directive to a variable.\nChange: [preventDefaultEvent] set default to false.\n\n\n2018.02.01: 1.1.0\n\nProvide [trackPosition] option: whether to track the element's movement. (PR by Blackbaud-MikitaYankouski)\nProvide [scale] option: to fix scaling issue #31\nProvide [preventDefaultEvent] option: whether to prevent default mouse or touch event. (default: true)\n\n\n\nInstallation\nnpm install angular2-draggable --saveDraggable\nPlease refer to the demo page.\n\nFirstly, import AngularDraggableModule in your app module (or any other proper angular module):\n import { AngularDraggableModule } from 'angular2-draggable';\n\n @NgModule({\n   imports: [\n     ...,\n     AngularDraggableModule\n   ],\n   ...\n })\n export class AppModule { }\nThen: use ngDraggable directive to make the DOM element draggable.\n\nSimple example:\n\nhtml:Drag me!\n\n\nUse [handle] to move parent element:\n\nhtml:\nI'm handle. Drag me!\nYou can't drag this block now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResizable\nPlease refer to the demo page.\nBesides of importing AngularDraggableModule, you need to import resizable.min.css in your project. If you use angular-cli, you can add this in angular.json:\n\"styles\": [\n    ...\n+   \"node_modules/angular2-draggable/css/resizable.min.css\"\n]Then you can use ngResizable directive to make the element resizable:\n I'm now resizable \n\n Resizable is disabled now \n\n Each side is resizable Well you can use both directives concurrently if you wish:\n I'm now draggable and resizable API\nDirective:\n\nngDraggable directive support following input porperties:\n  | Input | Type | Default | Description |\n  | ----- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |\n  | ngDraggable | boolean | true | You can toggle the draggable capability by setting true or false |\n  | handle | HTMLElement | null | Use template variable to refer to the handle element. Then only the handle element is draggable |\n  | zIndex | string | null | Use it to set z-index property when element is not moving |\n  | zIndexMoving | string | null | Use it to set z-index property when element is moving |\n  | bounds | HTMLElemnt | null | Use it to set the boundary |\n  | inBounds | boolean | false | Use it make element stay in the bounds |\n  | outOfBounds | { top: boolean; bottom: boolean; right: boolean; left: boolean } | false | Set it to allow element get out of bounds from the direction. Refer to demo |\n  | position | { x: number, y: number } | { x:0, y:0 } | Use it to set position offset |\n  | gridSize | number | 1 | Use it for snapping to grid. Refer to demo |\n\nngResizable directive support following input porperties:\n  | Input | Type | Default | Description |\n  | ----- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |\n  | ngResizable | boolean | true | You can toggle the resizable capability by setting true or false |\n  | rzHandles | string | \"e,s,se\" | Which handles can be used for resizing. Optional types in \"n,e,s,w,se,sw,ne,nw\" or \"all\" |\n  | rzAspectRatio | boolean|number | false | boolean: Whether the element should be constrained to a specific aspect ratio. number: Force the element to maintain a specific aspect ratio during resizing (width/height) |\n  | rzContainment | Selector|string|Element | null | Constrains resizing to within the bounds of the specified element or region. It accepts an HTMLElement, 'parent' or a valid CSS selector string such as '#id' |\n\n\nCSS:\n\nWhen ngDraggable is enabled on some element, ng-draggable class is automatically assigned to it. You can use it to customize the pointer style. For example:\n  .ng-draggable {\n    cursor: move;\n  }\nWhen ngResizable is enabled on some element, ng-resizable class is automatically assigned to it. And handle elements will be created with ng-resizable-handle. You can customize the handle style.\n\n\nEvents\n\nngDraggable directive:\n  | Output | $event | Description |\n  | ------ | ------ | ----------- |\n  | started | nativeElement of host | emitted when start dragging |\n  | stopped | nativeElement of host | emitted when stop dragging |\n  | edge | { top: boolean, right: boolean, bottom: boolean, left: boolean } | emitted after [bounds] is set |\n  | movingOffset | { x: number, y: number } | emit position offset when moving |\n  | endOffset | { x: number, y: number } | emit position offset when stop moving |\n  Simple example:\n  \n    Drag me!\n  \nngResizable directive:\n  | Output | $event | description |\n  | ------ | ------ | ----------- |\n  | rzStart | IResizeEvent | emitted when start resizing |\n  | rzResizing | IResizeEvent | emitted when resizing |\n  | rzStop | IResizeEvent | emitted when stop resizing |\n  export interface IResizeEvent {\n    host: any;\n    handle: any;\n    size: {\n      width: number;\n      height: number;\n    };\n    position: {\n      top: number;\n      left: number;\n    };\n  }  Simple example:\n  \n    Resizable\n  \n\nDemo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run demo\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn demoThe demo page server is listening to: http://localhost:4203\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Xie, Ziyu\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
